**Real-time haptic effect generation and control for ESP32.**

VectorHaptics lets you drive haptic actuators (LRAs, ERMs, voice coils) from an ESP32 via PWM or I2S—primitives (PULSE, TICK, VIBRATE, etc.), multi-channel control with tags, and optional audio-to-haptics streaming (Bluetooth A2DP, USB). Supports Serial, BLE, and WiFi; low-latency and suitable for VR/AR and real-time apps.
